    "Ans.  MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that uses JSON-like documents with optional schema to store data. It is designed to be scalable, flexible, and fast, and is often used for modern web applications, real-time analytics, and high-volume transactional systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, differ from traditional relational databases (SQL databases) in their data models, query languages, and storage architectures. They do not use tables, rows, and columns to store data, but instead use various data models such as key-value, document-oriented, graph-based, or column-family. They also typically have less strict data consistency and transaction support compared to SQL databases, but offer higher scalability and performance for certain types of workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in several scenarios, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "When the data is unstructured or semi-structured, or when the schema is not predefined or subject to frequent changes.\n",

    "When there is a need for horizontal scaling, sharding, or distributed architecture, as MongoDB can handle large volumes of data and high traffic more efficiently than SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is a need for high availability, automatic failover, and self-healing capabilities, as MongoDB has built-in support for replica sets and automatic recovery.\n",

    "Ans.  MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that provides a flexible and scalable approach to storing and managing data. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-Oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. This provides flexibility and scalability as data structures can be changed without having to modify the schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Performance: MongoDB is designed for high performance with features like index support, in-memory storage, and automatic sharding, which allows for horizontal scaling across multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Data Model: MongoDB supports a flexible data model, allowing you to store data of any type and structure. This makes it ideal for storing semi-structured and unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed Architecture: MongoDB is designed to run on distributed systems, allowing for easy scaling of data across multiple servers or clusters. This makes it suitable for large and complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication and High Availability: MongoDB supports automatic replication and high availability, ensuring that data is always available even in the event of server failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation Framework: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows for advanced data analysis and processing, making it suitable for complex analytical queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich Query Language: MongoDB provides a rich query language that supports complex queries and can handle large datasets efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB is a powerful and flexible database that provides a range of features and benefits for modern applications.\n",
