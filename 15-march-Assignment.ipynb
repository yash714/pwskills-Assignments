    "Training Set: The training set is used to fit the model to the data. In other words, the model learns the relationships between the input features and the output labels by minimizing the error or loss function on the training set.\n",

    "Testing Set: The testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model on new, unseen data. This set is used to estimate how well the model will perform in the real world, and is the most important set for evaluating the model's generalization ability.\n",

    "The process of splitting the data into these subsets is called train-validation-test split. Typically, the data is randomly divided into the three subsets in a proportion of around 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. However, these proportions can vary depending on the size and complexity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to ensure that the data is split randomly and that the subsets are representative of the underlying distribution of the data. This helps to avoid overfitting, which occurs when the model performs well on the training set but poorly on new, unseen data. By using a validation set to tune the hyperparameters and a separate testing set to evaluate the final performance, we can ensure that our model generalizes well to new data.\n",

Anomaly detection is the process of identifying data points that are significantly different from the majority of the data. Here are the basic steps involved in using unsupervised learning for anomaly detection:\n",
