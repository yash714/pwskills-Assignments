It is a density-based clustering algorithm that works by grouping together data points that are close to each other in a high-density region, while leaving out low-density regions as noise. DBSCAN has several advantages over other clustering algorithms, such as its ability to handle datasets with varying densities and its robustness to outliers.\n",

    "Density-based grouping: The algorithm starts by selecting a random point in the dataset and identifies all the points that are within a certain distance (called the epsilon neighborhood) from the point. These points are considered to be part of the same cluster if they satisfy two conditions: (a) they must have a minimum number of neighboring points within the epsilon neighborhood (called the minimum points), and (b) they must be reachable from each other by a chain of neighboring points.\n",
