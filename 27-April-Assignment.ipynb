    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Clustering: In this algorithm, the data points are grouped based on their similarity and a dendrogram is formed, which shows the relationship between the different clusters. Hierarchical clustering can be further divided into two types: Agglomerative and Divisive.\n",

    "DBSCAN: In this algorithm, the data points are separated into two types: core points and noise points. Core points are defined as points with a predefined number of other points within a specific radius. Noise points are defined as points that do not belong to any core points.\n",
