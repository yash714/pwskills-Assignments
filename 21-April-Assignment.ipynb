    "The Euclidean distance metric measures the straight-line distance between two data points in the feature space, which is the shortest possible distance between them. The Euclidean distance between two data points A and B with n dimensions can be computed as follows:\n",

    "d(A, B) = sqrt((A1 - B1)^2 + (A2 - B2)^2 + ... + (An - Bn)^2)\n",

    "The choice between Euclidean and Manhattan distance metrics can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor depending on the nature of the data and the problem being solved. In general, the Euclidean distance metric is better suited for problems where the features have continuous values and are correlated. On the other hand, the Manhattan distance metric is better suited for problems where the features are discrete or uncorrelated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a problem where the features represent the physical measurements of objects in a 2D space, the Euclidean distance metric might be more appropriate as it measures the shortest distance between two points in the same space. However, in a problem where the features represent the frequency of occurrence of different words in a text corpus, the Manhattan distance metric might be more appropriate as it measures the distance between two data points along the axes of the word frequencies.\n",

    "Elbow Method: The elbow method is a graphical approach that involves plotting the performance metric (e.g., accuracy, RMSE) against different k values and selecting the k value where the performance metric starts to plateau.
