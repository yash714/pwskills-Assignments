    "The Filter method is a feature selection technique that selects the most relevant features for a machine learning model based on a statistical measure. The Filter method involves two main steps:\n",

    "Feature ranking: In this step, a statistical metric is used to measure the relevance of each feature to the target variable. Examples of such metrics include correlation coefficient, mutual information, chi-squared test, and ANOVA F-value. The features are then ranked based on their relevance scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection: In this step, a subset of the top-ranked features is selected based on a predefined threshold or a fixed number of features. The selected features are then used to train a machine learning model.\n",

    "The Filter method is computationally efficient and easy to implement. However, it has some limitations. For example, it does not consider the interaction between features, and it may select redundant features that are highly correlated with each other. Therefore, the performance of the resulting machine learning model may not be optimal. Nonetheless, the Filter method is a good starting point for feature selection, and it can be used in combination with other techniques such as Wrapper and Embedded methods to improve the performance of the model.\n",

These methods include algorithms that learn the importance of features as part of the optimization process, and can be used to find the optimal subset of features for the given model. Some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: Regularization is a technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function during model training. This penalty term discourages the model from assigning high weights to irrelevant features, effectively reducing the number of features used in the model. Examples of regularization methods include L1 and L2 regularization.\n",

    "Gradient Descent-based methods: Gradient descent-based methods are optimization algorithms used in deep learning models such as Neural Networks. These methods can be used to adjust the weights of the network while simultaneously selecting the most relevant features.\n",

    "Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is a machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. SVMs use a kernel function to transform the data into a higher-dimensional space, where a hyperplane is used to separate the data into distinct classes. The kernel function implicitly performs feature selection, as only the most relevant features are used in the transformation.\n",

    "Limited to Univariate Analysis: The Filter method relies on univariate statistical tests to evaluate each feature independently of the other features in the dataset. This approach can lead to the selection of irrelevant features that may not contribute to the predictive power of the model.

    "Not Model-Specific: The Filter method is not model-specific and may not take into account the specific requirements of the model being used. This can lead to the selection of features that are not optimal for the model, leading to reduced accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitive to Data Preprocessing: The Filter method is sensitive to the type of data preprocessing that is performed. Different preprocessing techniques can lead to different feature rankings, which can impact the overall performance of the model.\n",
