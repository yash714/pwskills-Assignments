    "Ans. In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an error occurs, Python creates an exception object, which contains information about the error, such as the type of error and where it occurred in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are used to handle errors and unexpected situations in a program. By handling exceptions, a program can gracefully recover from errors and continue executing, instead of crashing or producing incorrect results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A syntax error, on the other hand, is a type of error that occurs when there is a problem with the syntax of the code. For example, if you forget to close a parenthesis or misspell a keyword, you will get a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between an exception and a syntax error is that an exception is a runtime error that occurs when a program is executing, while a syntax error is a compile-time error that occurs before the program is executed. Another difference is that syntax errors are typically easier to fix than exceptions, as they usually indicate a clear mistake in the code, whereas exceptions can be caused by a variety of factors and require more careful debugging.\n",
