    "\n",
    "ReLU(x) = max(0, x)\n",

    "Here, α is a small positive constant. Leaky ReLU addresses the \"dying ReLU\" problem where neurons can become unresponsive if their output consistently falls below zero.\n",

Non-linear activation functions allow neural networks to learn and represent highly nonlinear patterns in the data. Without non-linear activation functions, a neural network would simply be a linear combination of its inputs, severely limiting its expressive power.\n",

    "Gradient Flow and Vanishing/Exploding Gradients: During backpropagation, gradients are propagated through the network to update the weights. Activation functions can impact the flow of gradients. If an activation function has very small gradients, such as in the case of sigmoid or tanh functions, it can lead to the problem of vanishing gradients, where the gradients become extremely small as they propagate backward through the network layers. This can hinder the learning process, especially in deep networks. On the other hand, if an activation function has very large gradients, it can result in exploding gradients, causing instability in the training process. Activation functions like ReLU and its variants address the vanishing gradient problem to some extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparsity and Activation Distribution: Activation functions can affect the sparsity of activation patterns in a network. Some activation functions, such as ReLU, can produce sparse activations, where only a subset of neurons is active for a given input. Sparse activations can improve computational efficiency by reducing the number of active neurons. Additionally, activation functions influence the distribution of activation values across the network, which can impact the stability and convergence of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Range and Interpretability: The output range of an activation function can impact the interpretability of the network's output. For example, sigmoid and softmax functions produce outputs in the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities. Tanh activation function outputs are in the range [-1, 1]. Activation functions with bounded output ranges can be useful in certain applications where the output needs to be constrained within a specific range.\n",

    "Disadvantages of the sigmoid activation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Vanishing Gradient: The sigmoid function suffers from the vanishing gradient problem. When the input to the sigmoid function is very large or very small, the derivative approaches zero, resulting in extremely small gradients during backpropagation.

    "Output Saturation: The sigmoid function saturates at the extreme ends of its range, meaning that for very large positive or negative inputs, the output values become close to 1 or 0, respectively. In these regions, the function becomes nearly flat, resulting in gradients close to zero. This saturation can also lead to the vanishing gradient problem.\n",

    "Biased Outputs: The output of the sigmoid function is biased towards the middle of the range (around 0.5), which means that inputs far away from zero tend to be mapped to values close to either 0 or 1.
