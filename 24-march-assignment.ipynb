    "Chlorides: the amount of salts in wine, which can affect the taste and stability of wine.\n",
    "Free sulfur dioxide: the amount of SO2 that is free and available to bind with other compounds in wine, which can protect wine from oxidation and bacterial growth.\n",
    "Total sulfur dioxide: the total amount of SO2 in wine, including both free and bound forms.\n",
    "Density: the density of wine, which can provide information about the alcohol content and sugar content.\n",

    "\n",
    "Alcohol: Wine with a higher alcohol content tends to have a higher quality rating, as it can provide a fuller body and more complex flavor.\n",
    "Volatile acidity: High levels of volatile acidity can contribute to a sour taste and spoilage, which can lower the quality rating of wine.\n",
    "Citric acid: The presence of citric acid can provide a fresh taste and balance other flavors, which can contribute to a higher quality rating.\n",
    "pH: The acidity or basicity of wine can affect the taste and stability of wine, and a balanced pH level is often associated with higher quality wines.\n",
    "Residual sugar: The amount of sugar left after fermentation can affect the sweetness and body of wine, and a moderate amount of residual sugar is often associated with higher quality wines.\n",

    "One common technique for handling missing data is imputation, where missing values are replaced with estimated values based on other information in the dataset. There are several advantages and disadvantages to different imputation techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean/median imputation: This involves replacing missing values with the mean or median value of the feature. The advantage of this technique is that it is simple and can work well if the missing values are missing at random (MAR), meaning the missingness is unrelated to the feature value or other variables in the dataset. The disadvantage is that it can distort the distribution of the feature and underestimate the uncertainty in the imputed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode imputation: This involves replacing missing values with the most frequent value of the feature. The advantage of this technique is that it is simple and can work well for categorical features with a small number of unique values. The disadvantage is that it can lead to biased estimates if the mode is not representative of the true underlying distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression imputation: This involves predicting missing values based on other variables in the dataset using a regression model. The advantage of this technique is that it can handle complex relationships between variables and can result in more accurate estimates. The disadvantage is that it can be sensitive to outliers and model assumptions, and can result in biased estimates if the relationships between variables are misspecified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple imputation: This involves generating multiple imputed datasets based on different plausible imputation models and combining the results using a set of rules. The advantage of this technique is that it can account for uncertainty in the imputed values and result in more accurate estimates. The disadvantage is that it can be computationally intensive and require more assumptions than single imputation methods.\n",

The model could also include interaction terms to explore how different factors may interact with each other.\n",

For example, categorical variables such as gender, race/ethnicity, and lunch status were one-hot encoded to convert them into numerical variables. The parental education variable was also transformed into a numerical variable by assigning a value based on the highest level of education attained by the parents. In addition, the math, reading, and writing scores were standardized to ensure that they had the same scale and range.\n",
