    "Ans. Multithreading in Python is a programming technique where multiple threads of execution can exist concurrently within a single process. Each thread runs independently, and they can share common resources such as memory, file handles, and network sockets.\n",

    "Multithreading is used in Python to perform tasks concurrently, making the best use of available resources and improving the overall performance of the program. For example, you can use multithreading to handle multiple client connections in a server application or to perform time-consuming tasks in the background while keeping the user interface responsive.\n",

Instead, call the start() method to start the thread.\n",

    "join(): This function waits for the thread to complete its execution. When a thread is started, it will run in a separate thread of execution, and the parent thread will continue to run its own code. The join() method can be used to wait for the thread to complete its execution before the parent thread continues. The join() method blocks the parent thread until the target thread completes its execution.\n",

    "Race conditions: Multithreading can result in race conditions where multiple threads try to access the same resource at the same time, leading to unpredictable behavior.\n",

Deadlocks can cause the program to hang, become unresponsive, or crash.\n",
