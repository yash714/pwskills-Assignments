    "Elastic Net Regression is a type of regularized linear regression that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization penalties to overcome their individual limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional linear regression, the objective is to minimize the sum of squared residuals. However, this can lead to overfitting, particularly when the number of features is large. Regularization techniques like L1 and L2 help to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 regularization (Lasso) adds a penalty term equal to the absolute value of the coefficients, which tends to produce sparse models by driving some coefficients to zero. This makes it useful for feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 regularization (Ridge) adds a penalty term equal to the square of the coefficients, which helps to reduce the impact of multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients towards zero.\n",

    "Elastic Net Regression combines the strengths of both L1 and L2 regularization. It adds a penalty term to the loss function that is a linear combination of both the L1 and L2 penalty terms, controlled by a parameter called alpha. This allows Elastic Net to handle both feature selection and multicollinearity simultaneously, making it more robust than Lasso or Ridge on their own.\n",

    "Coefficients with larger magnitudes are more important: In Elastic Net Regression, the regularization penalties encourage sparsity in the coefficients, meaning that many of them will be set to zero.
