    "In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects that share similar attributes and behavior. It defines the attributes and methods that an object can have, but it does not create an actual object. Instead, an object is an instance of a class, which means it is a specific implementation of that class with its own values for the class attributes.\n",

    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the technique of wrapping data and code together in a single unit called a class. It allows for the separation of the internal workings of an object from the external interface, making the object easier to use and maintain.\n",
