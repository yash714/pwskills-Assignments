    "Linear regression and logistic regression are both machine learning models used in statistical analysis, but they differ in their applications and objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a statistical model used to predict the value of a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. The output of a linear regression model is a continuous numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a linear regression model could be used to predict the price of a house based on its square footage, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors. In this scenario, the dependent variable (price) is continuous, and the independent variables (square footage, number of bedrooms) are also continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression, on the other hand, is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. It assumes a non-linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The output of a logistic regression model is a probability value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, logistic regression can be used to predict the likelihood of a person developing a particular disease based on their age, gender, and other relevant factors. In this scenario, the dependent variable (disease) is categorical (either present or absent), and the independent variables (age, gender) can be continuous or categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, logistic regression is more appropriate when the dependent variable is categorical and the objective is to predict the probability of the event occurring. Linear regression, on the other hand, is more appropriate when the dependent variable is continuous and the objective is to predict the value of that variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in a scenario where we want to predict whether a customer will buy a particular product or not based on their demographics and browsing behavior on a website, logistic regression would be more appropriate as the dependent variable is categorical (buy or not buy). Whereas, if we want to predict the amount of money a customer would spend on a product based on their demographics and purchase history, linear regression would be more appropriate as the dependent variable is continuous (amount of money spent).\n",

    "L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the model parameters. The L1 regularization term is defined as:\n",

    "L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the model parameters. The L2 regularization term is defined as:\n",
