    "\n",
    "Web scraping is used for various purposes such as market research, data analysis, price monitoring, lead generation, and content aggregation. By automating the data collection process, web scraping enables businesses to save time, money, and resources that would have otherwise been spent manually collecting data.\n",

    "Here are three areas where web scraping is commonly used:\n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce: E-commerce websites use web scraping to collect product information from competitors’ websites to monitor pricing, identify trends, and optimize their own pricing strategy.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using libraries: There are several libraries available in different programming languages, such as Python’s Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Selenium, which can be used to scrape web data. These libraries provide a set of functions to navigate and parse the web pages to extract the required data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Application programming interface (API): Some websites offer APIs that allow developers to access their data in a structured format. This makes it easier to collect data from these websites without the need for web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions: Regular expressions can be used to extract specific pieces of data from web pages. This method is useful for extracting text data from web pages, such as email addresses or phone numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping tools: There are several web scraping tools available that can automate the process of data extraction. These tools provide a graphical user interface that allows users to configure the data extraction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom code: For complex web scraping tasks, custom code can be written to scrape data from websites. This method provides more flexibility and control over the scraping process, but it requires more programming skills and time.\n",
