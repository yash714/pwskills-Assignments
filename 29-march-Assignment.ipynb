    "Lasso Regression, or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a type of linear regression that performs both variable selection and regularization. Lasso Regression is similar to Ridge Regression in that it adds a penalty term to the cost function, but it differs in that it uses the L1 norm of the coefficients instead of the L2 norm used in Ridge Regression. The L1 norm encourages sparsity in the coefficient estimates, which means that it tends to set some of the coefficients to zero, effectively performing variable selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other regression techniques, Lasso Regression has the advantage of producing a more interpretable model by setting some coefficients to zero and selecting only the most important features. This can be particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets with many features. In contrast, other regression techniques, such as OLS regression, do not perform variable selection and may result in overfitting when dealing with a large number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Lasso Regression has the advantage of being more robust to outliers compared to other regression techniques, as the L1 norm is less sensitive to outliers compared to the L2 norm used in Ridge Regression.
