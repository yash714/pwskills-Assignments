    "Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to study the relationship between two continuous variables. It involves estimating a linear relationship between a dependent variable (y) and an independent variable (x). The relationship can be summarized by a straight line equation: y = a + bx, where a is the intercept, b is the slope, x is the independent variable, and y is the dependent variable. An example of simple linear regression is to study the relationship between the age of a car and its resale value. In this case, age is the independent variable, and resale value is the dependent variable.\n",

    "Multiple linear regression, on the other hand, is a statistical method used to study the relationship between a dependent variable (y) and two or more independent variables (x1, x2, x3, etc.).

An example of multiple linear regression is to study the relationship between the sales of a product and various factors such as advertising, price, and customer satisfaction. In this case, advertising, price, and customer satisfaction are the independent variables, and sales are the dependent variable.\n",
