    "Hierarchical clustering is different from other clustering techniques such as K-means clustering, in that it does not require a pre-specified number of clusters.

Additionally, hierarchical clustering does not assume any specific shape or size of the clusters and can handle non-convex or irregularly shaped clusters. However, hierarchical clustering can be computationally expensive for large datasets, and the resulting hierarchy can be difficult to interpret in some cases.\n",

At each iteration, the distance between clusters is calculated using a suitable distance metric, such as Euclidean distance or cosine similarity.
