    "The decision tree classifier is a popular algorithm used in machine learning for solving classification problems. It is a non-parametric model, which means it does not assume any specific functional form for the decision boundary between classes, and can adapt to complex relationships between the input features and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm builds a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences by recursively splitting the dataset into smaller subsets based on the values of the input features. The goal is to create a tree that can accurately predict the target variable for new, unseen instances.\n",

    "The general steps involved in building a decision tree classifier are as follows:\n",

    "It assigns the majority class of the instances in the leaf node as the predicted class for new, unseen instances.\n",
    "Once the decision tree is constructed, making predictions involves traversing the tree from the root node down to a leaf node based on the values of the input features. At each internal node, the algorithm tests the value of the corresponding feature and selects the appropriate branch to follow based on whether the value is above or below a threshold. At each leaf node, the algorithm outputs the majority class of the instances in that node as the predicted class.\n",

    "Overall, decision trees are easy to understand and interpret, and can handle both categorical and continuous features. However, they are prone to overfitting and can be sensitive to small changes in the data.

    "\n",
    "Interpret the results: Interpret the decision tree by examining the splits and the feature importance scores. The feature importance scores indicate the relative importance of each feature in predicting the target variable.\n",

At each internal node, we compare the feature value of the instance with the split threshold and move to the left or right child node depending on whether the value is less than or greater than the threshold. We continue this process until we reach a leaf node, which contains the predicted class label for the instance.\n",

    "The decision tree classification algorithm essentially learns a set of if-then rules that partition the feature space into regions corresponding to different classes.

    "The advantage of decision tree classification is that it can model complex decision boundaries and handle interactions between features. For example, if two features interact in a nonlinear way to predict the target variable, the decision tree can capture this by splitting on a combination of the features at an internal node. Moreover, decision trees are interpretable and can be visualized as a tree diagram that shows the splits and the feature importance scores.\n",
