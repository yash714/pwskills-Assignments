    "Ans. Advantages of using API:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased efficiency and productivity: API simplifies the process of building an application by allowing developers to access existing code and functionality. This saves time and resources, increasing efficiency and productivity.\n",

    "Improved user experience: APIs enable developers to create more powerful and feature-rich applications that provide a better user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better integration: APIs allow different software systems to communicate with each other, making it easier to integrate different applications and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Platform independence: APIs can be used across different platforms, operating systems, and programming languages, making them versatile and flexible.\n",

    "Innovation: APIs enable developers to build new applications and services that build on top of existing systems, encouraging innovation and creativity.\n",

    "Security risks: APIs can expose data and functionality to external parties, increasing the risk of security breaches and data leaks.\n",

    "Reliance on third-party services: Applications that rely on third-party APIs are vulnerable to service outages, changes in API specifications, and other issues that can affect their functionality.\n",

SOAP APIs use the SOAP protocol to communicate between applications, which requires more overhead than REST.
