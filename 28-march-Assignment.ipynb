    "Ridge Regression is a regularization technique used in linear regression to prevent overfitting of the model. It adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) cost function to control the size of the coefficients.\n",

    "In OLS regression, the goal is to minimize the sum of the squared residuals between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable. However, this approach may result in overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on the new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression addresses the overfitting issue by adding a penalty term to the OLS cost function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. This penalty term shrinks the coefficients towards zero, which reduces the complexity of the model and helps to prevent overfitting. The amount of shrinkage is controlled by a hyperparameter called lambda (λ).\n",

    "\n",
    "Linearity: Ridge Regression assumes that the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear. If the relationship is non-linear, then the model may not provide accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: Ridge Regression assumes that the observations in the data set are independent of each other. This means that the error terms should not be correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: Ridge Regression assumes that the variance of the error terms is constant across all levels of the independent variables. This is known as homoscedasticity. If the error terms have varying variances, then the model may not provide accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: Ridge Regression assumes that the error terms are normally distributed. If the error terms are not normally distributed, then the model may not provide accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "No multicollinearity: Ridge Regression assumes that there is no multicollinearity among the independent variables. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated with each other. In such cases, Ridge Regression may not be effective in reducing overfitting.\n",

Ridge Regression does not make any additional assumptions beyond those of linear regression.

A larger value of lambda results in greater shrinkage and a simpler model with smaller coefficients.

On the other hand, a smaller value of lambda leads to less shrinkage and a more complex model with larger coefficients. However, if lambda is too small, it may lead to overfitting and poor performance on the test data.\n",

In k-fold cross-validation, the data is divided into k-folds, and the model is trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, with each fold serving as the test set once. The average test error is computed for each value of lambda, and the value that minimizes the test error is selected as the optimal lambda.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search: Another approach is to use grid search to search for the optimal value of lambda over a range of values. In this method, a range of lambda values is specified, and the model is trained and tested on each lambda value.

Cross-validation is a computationally intensive approach but provides an accurate estimate of the model's performance on new data. Grid search is less computationally intensive but may miss the optimal lambda value if the range of lambda values is not sufficiently wide.\n",

Ridge Regression can help identify the most important predictors by shrinking the coefficients of less important predictors towards zero, thereby effectively reducing the number of predictors in the model. Here are some ways Ridge Regression can be used for feature selection:\n",

The predictors with larger coefficients are considered more important than those with smaller coefficients.\n",

    "Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): RFE is a popular technique for feature selection using Ridge Regression. In this method, the model is trained on all the predictors, and the least important predictor is eliminated iteratively until the desired number of predictors is left. The importance of the predictors is determined by the magnitude of the coefficients. The process can be automated using a stepwise procedure that starts with all predictors and eliminates one predictor at each step based on the smallest coefficient magnitude.\n",

    "Lasso Regression: Lasso Regression is another regularization technique similar to Ridge Regression but with a different penalty term. Lasso Regression is known to have a built-in feature selection property.

Therefore, Lasso Regression can be used for feature selection by identifying the predictors with non-zero coefficients.\n",
